# üåü Model API Service

Welcome to the **Model API Service**! This directory encompasses the core functionalities of the project, designed to deliver a seamless experience.

## üîç Core Features

1. **Model Implementation**:  
   - Utilizes **GPT-4o** with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** via LangChain.  
   - Code is organized into two primary modules: 
     - **`llm_route.py`**: Manages responses from the language model.
     - **`tree_route.py`**: Provides course recommendations using a decision tree algorithm.

2. **API Service Creation**:  
   - Built on **Langserve/FastAPI** for efficient API service.  
   - Main service code can be found in **`main.py`**.

3. **Deployment**:  
   - Currently hosted locally for development purposes.
