BU MET CS Course Building Chatbot

Using REACT, Java, and Python, our team plans to make a web application leveraging the Llama 2 Chatbot feature.
Due to the lack of access to the BU Registration MS database, we decided to make our database using MongoDB and a decision tree to determine the recommended course for the upcoming semester.
We will also include features: Emailing, Printing, and sharing chat history, Caching chat history, Security measures, and Authentication function.
